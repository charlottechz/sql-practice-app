# Break Into Tech ‚Äì SQL Pratice Playground - Project Brief

## Overview

This is the official development repository for the Break Into Tech SQL Practice Playground, a browser-based learning tool that allows students to:
- Generate fake but realistic SQL databases based on a topic or business type
- Write and run SQL queries directly in the browser (using sql.js)
- Receive AI-powered coaching help when their queries fail or when in help mode (via a separate Claude API)

The playground will be embedded into the Break Into Tech website via an iFrame at:  
**https://breakintotech.com/resources/sql-practice**
